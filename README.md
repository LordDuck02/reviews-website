# reviews-website

A very simple website to display reviews from a .json file.

Of course, in a real website, you would probably want to use a database to store the reviews and a backend to handle the requests. But this is just a simple example to show how to display reviews from a .json file.

In another words, this was just a website I made since I had nothing to do.
